                    <p id="about">Over six decades, American microbiologist Maurice Ralph Hilleman (1919â€“2005) unlocked the secrets of immunology and went on to develop about 40 vaccines. Among his credits are vaccines for measles, mumps, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox, meningitis, and pneumonia, all of which are routinely recommended for youngsters. Each year, Hilleman's vaccines save millions of people worldwide from death, deafness, blindness, and other permanent disabilities.
